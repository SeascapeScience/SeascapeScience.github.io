Our lab group recently collaborated on a paper just out, “_The surprising oceanography of the Gulf of Maine_”. We were broadly asking about ocean / climate surprises that have happened historically, and what we might have to prepare for in the future. The question is challenging and a bit paradoxical, because if we were prepared, it wouldn’t be a surprise. Yet the extreme events that catch us off guard are really dangerous.

There are different types of surprises we discussed. The sea level rise discussion captures one type of surprise called open surprises:

“_For sea level rise, for example, we know that there is an on-going
climate-driven process occurring, but sea level rise tends to
do its damage during sudden events, where the background
sea level rise is amplified by the coincidence of a high tide
and a storm surge. This type of event can reshape a coastline
suddenly and unexpectedly, even when people are aware
of the issue_.”

This turned out to be prescient, as just a month later, in early January of this year, we had a climate disaster in Maine where this process played out, causing major damage along the coast of Maine.

The other type of surprises, closed surprises, it a bit like the “unknown unknowns”. We discussed a few possibilities:
 - New harmful algal or bacterial species affecting human health (e.g. HABs, Vibrio)
 - Pathogens affecting fisheries directly, such as epizootic shell disease in lobsters
 - Extreme precipitation events

How do you prepare for the unexpected? There are a few ideas we discuss in the paper, such as something called "foresighting". It's a tough question, but there's a shift in focus that we need in order to incorporate this type of event into our preparations. This quote from Wally Broecker in 1987 captures it well:

"_My suspicion is that we have been lulled into complacency
by model simulations that suggest a gradual warming over a
period of about 100 years._"
